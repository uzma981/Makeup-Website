# Makeup-Website

## Background
↪️ My first website using Html,Css and Javascript.


## Implementation
⭐Applied correct hyperlink description – this is so that user’s will be able to understand where the link will go to and explains the context of the link. Many external links are included to guide the user about the different product recommendations without the user physically finding the products themselves, which makes it a lot easier for them to explore around. 
⭐	Used media queries- When the user changes the width of the page, the background colour will change from grey to white, this is so that content in the containers are emphasised a lot more behind the white background. This is also ideal for users who are viewing the screen small in a day light which makes it a lot easier to see the page. . 
- Navigation menu: The hover feature in the navigation menu allows the user to hover their mouse over the buttons of the menu bar. The button will turn from grey to pink so that users are aware that the buttons are if they click on the button then it will take them to a different page. 
⭐Tested on different devices- Included media queries so that the website is visible on different devices. Many people don’t always use a laptop or computer to surf, therefore making the website interactive on both a mobile and tablet device is effective for any user.  
⭐Colour scheme: The grey and pink theme is mostly to those who have a passion for makeup. The pink theme derives from the common makeup colour that is used and the grey colour gives the whole website a professional look. The navigation bar has a dark grey colour so that the white text can stand out to be able to easily distinguish for individuals with low vision. Each container has a light pink background colour and borders so that users can effectively differentiate between the different contents, this allows a visual separation between each content of information.
