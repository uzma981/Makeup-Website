<h3> Natural Glam Red Lip</h3>
<p> This look consists of using minimal products on your skin to create the most natural , radiant glow to your face. This look is ideal if you’re wanting to enhance your natural features, which consists of a simple eyeliner, curled lashes with a bold red lipstick to catch the attention. The real focus will be on the highlighter and the red lipstick, therefore opting for a waterbased foundation or even a tinted moisturiser would be ideal as it sinks into the skin giving it the overall natural glam.  </p>

<h3> Soft and Pink </h3>
<p>There are many shades of pink, so picking the right one is essential for yourself. Starting off with a light pink and slowly building up for the transition shade allows you take your time to blend in the pink eyeshadows together. Choosing a softer pink/coral blush will also add some extra ‘barbie’ like feeling and give your cheeks a little tint to it. Finally ending It with a transparent gloss or a nude lipstick will create an even distribution of shades across your face. </p>

<h3> Brown smokey bronzed</h3>
<p>If youre going on a date night, or even feeling bold the brown smokey look is the one for you. Applying bronzer all over your cheeks and forehead gives the illusion of a smaller and more of a heart shaped face. It also gives you a tanned look and you can top it off with a pink liquid lipstick. The real focus will be on the eyes where you can add hint of gold to the inner corners of your eyes. </p>
