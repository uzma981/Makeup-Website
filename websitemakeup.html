<h3>Introduction to Makeup&Co</h3>
<p> This website is based on giving you an insight on the makeup world that we are living in today. Makeup does not define your beauty and you should be confident in your own skin and use makeup to enhance your beauty. You should always take care of your skin before piling on foundation as you need to keep it young and fresh with daily skin care. Try investing in cheap drugstore makeup before diving in to the expensive high end products that will blow your purse. I would highly recommend starting with a small makeup kit before building on a collection of foundations and concealers. We will first focus on my best recommendations for <strong>affordable products </strong>to start off with.</p>
